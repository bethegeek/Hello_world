The definition of free software consists of four freedoms (freedoms 0 through 3). Which of the following is NOT one of the freedoms that are part of the definition? Select all that apply.

The freedom to restrict access to the source code for the software.

The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.

The freedom to prevent users from using the software for undesirable purposes.

The freedom to sell the software for any price.

The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.

The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.

If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression rbind(x, y)?

7. 
A key property of vectors in R is that

a vector cannot have have attributes like dimensions

elements of a vector all must be of the same class

the length of a vector must be less than 32,768

elements of a vector can be of different classes

elements of a vector can only be character or numeric

=> elements of a vector all must be of the same class

8. 
Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[2]] give me? Select all that apply.

a character vector of length 1.

a character vector containing the letter "a".

a list containing a character vector with the elements "a" and "b".

a character vector with the elements "a" and "b".

a list containing character vector with the letter "a".

=> a character vector of length 1.

a numeric vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 4.

a numeric vector with elements 3, 4, 5, 6.

a numeric vector with elements 1, 2, 3, 6.

an integer vector with elements 3, 2, 3, 6.

=> a numeric vector with elements 3, 4, 5, 6. 

10. 
Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.

x[x == 4] > 10

x[x >= 11] <- 4

x[x > 10] <- 4

x[x > 10] == 4

x[x == 10] <- 4

x[x >= 10] <- 4

x[x > 4] <- 10

x[x < 10] <- 4

=> x[x > 10] <- 4 , x[x >= 11] <- 4
